# Coin Simulations

If we have access to a biased coin, one that deviates from the fair split between 'Heads' and 'Tails', this can be used to simulate a fair coin. This is done by flipping pairs of coins until the outcomes are different. 

Different results (for example 'Heads' on coin one; 'Tails' on coin two) have an identical probability to the reverse outcome. Thus, we return the outcome on one coin (in my code, this is 'first') and get get 'Heads' or 'Tails' both with 0.5 probability.
